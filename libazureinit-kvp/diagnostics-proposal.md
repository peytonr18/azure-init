# KVP Diagnostics Specification

## Background

Diagnostics are the records a provisioning client emits to explain what a boot did: spans that mark when an operation such as `provision:run` starts and finishes, and point observations that capture a single event or artifact, such as an IMDS result or a `dmesg` snapshot. They let an operator or the host reconstruct a boot and triage a failure after the fact, including when the guest is no longer reachable.

A Hyper-V guest carries these records to the host through a KVP pool: a flat namespace of key=value records that the host copies out of the running guest. We already have `KvpPoolStore`, which gives raw, in-order access to that pool but no notion of diagnostics.

The pool constrains the design in four ways:

- A record is a flat key=value pair. The key is the only structured metadata; the value is opaque bytes to the pool.
- Keys and values are size-capped. The safe key limit is 254 bytes and the safe value limit is 1022 bytes, so a message larger than the value limit cannot fit in one record and must span several records that share a key and differ only by a trailing index.
- The host may copy or truncate the pool at any moment. A reader can find a group whose members are missing, duplicated, or out of order.
- There is no native grouping or typing. A diagnostic event exists only as a convention encoded in the key and the value.

This spec defines a next-generation diagnostics format for a provisioning client (azure-init), the writer that produces it, and the reader that interprets the pool. cloud-init also writes diagnostics into the same pool in its own format; reading those is a separate read-only concern (see Compatibility).

### Records today

Both producers already write diagnostics into the pool, in two different shapes.

azure-init uses a pipe-delimited key with a plain-text value and no encoding field. The `type` token is `start`, `finish`, or `event`; a value over the size limit is split with a trailing chunk index:

```text
<agent>|<boot_epoch>|<vm_id>|<type>|<name>|<event_id>|<timestamp>|<chunk_index>

# point event, one record
azure-init-0.1.1|1700000000|vm-abc|event|imds|8f3e9c4a-1b2c-4d5e-9f01-234567890abc|2026-07-27T21:33:24.300Z|0
  value: Retrieved 1 key from IMDS

# span start

  value: starting

# span finish, same event_id as its start

  value: provisioning succeeded

# long value split across records, one event_id, indices 0..N
azure-init-0.1.1|1700000000|vm-abc|event|config:dump|1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d-1e2f3a4b5c6d|<ts>|0   value: <chunk 0>

```

cloud-init puts the type and name before the identifiers; a current key carries a `vm_id` that an older key omits. The value is JSON with `ts` and `msg`, `result` and `duration` on a finish, `msg_i` per chunk on a split value, and an `{encoding, data}` envelope inside `msg` when compressed:

```text

  msg -> "line1\nline2" (reassembled from the two chunks)

# compressed artifact: type=compressed, msg holds an {encoding, data} envelope; a large one splits like the value above
CLOUD_INIT|1785187982|compressed|dmesg|0e5e179d-5341-478b-8456-fbb90621bdf8|d4e5f6a7-b8c9-0d1e-2f3a-4b5c6d7e8f90|0

  msg -> {"encoding":"gz+b64","data":"H4sIAAAA..."}
```

The two disagree on field order, on where the timestamp and encoding live, and on whether the value is text or JSON.

## Proposed design

This proposal defines one versioned record format for azure-init and separate reader and writer interfaces over `KvpPoolStore`. The reader interprets the pool; the writer produces only the azure-init format. Untyped access remains on `KvpPoolStore` itself.

### Diagnostics format

The proposed key is the current azure-init key with a few changes, all keeping metadata in the key. It is pipe-delimited with `|` reserved, begins with a diagnostic schema-version identifier, and always ends with the chunk index, so a single-record value still ends in `|0`:

```text
AZURE_INIT_V1|<agent>|<boot_epoch>|<vm_id>|<kind>|<name>|<event_id>|<timestamp>|<encoding>|<result>|<duration>|<chunk_index>
```

- `AZURE_INIT_V1` is the `diagnostic_version_id`: `AZURE_INIT` identifies the diagnostics family and `V1` identifies version 1 of its wire schema. That schema covers the field layout, required and optional fields, token meanings, units, encoding rules, and chunk framing. It is one self-identifying token rather than a bare number because the pool also contains unrelated keys: a reader can recognize an unsupported future `AZURE_INIT_V*` record without mistaking an arbitrary numeric key for a diagnostic. It is separate from `agent`, which remains the producer identifier and whose version identifies the producer binary. A schema change requires a new `diagnostic_version_id`; an agent release by itself does not.
- `type` becomes `kind`, narrowed to the three timeline positions (`start`/`finish`/`event`); any other category is carried by `name`, `encoding`, or `result`, not a token.
- `encoding` names the payload encoding in the key so a large artifact can be compressed.
- `result` and `duration` are the finish's verdict fields, carried in the key: `result` is a `success`/`fail` token and `duration` is the elapsed milliseconds. Both are required on a finish, optional on an event, and empty on a start. Everything else, including the plain-text value, is unchanged.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| diagnostic_version_id | `AZURE_INIT_V1`; identifies the wire schema and selects its parser before any later field is interpreted |
| agent | Producer identifier, such as `azure-init-0.1.1` |
| boot_epoch | Unix seconds of the boot that produced the record |
| vm_id | VM identity |
| kind | `start` or `finish` for a span, `event` for a point observation |
| name | Subject, such as `provision:run` or `dmesg` |
| event_id | Shared by a span's start and finish, and by every chunk of one value |
| timestamp | RFC 3339 (ISO 8601), UTC with a `Z` suffix, millisecond precision, e.g. `2026-08-31T12:34:56.789Z` |
| encoding | How the value is encoded: `none`, `b64`, or `gz+b64` |
| result | `success` or `fail` on a finish, optionally on an event; empty otherwise |
| duration | Elapsed milliseconds on a finish, optionally on a timed event; empty otherwise |
| chunk_index | Chunk position, from 0 |

#### Key size

The whole key is one string, and the host silently truncates a guest-written key past 254 UTF-8 bytes; safe-mode `KvpPoolStore` rejects it first. The fixed fields spend most of that budget: `vm_id` and `event_id` at 36 bytes each plus the 24-byte `timestamp` are already 96 bytes, and `AZURE_INIT_V1` adds another 13 before the enums, numbers, and delimiters. A representative finish key runs about 190 bytes, leaving roughly 64 for the two free-form fields.

Only `agent` and `name` are free-form; every other field is bounded by its format or its enum. The writer caps the two so the whole key cannot exceed 254 bytes:

| Field | Cap | Bounded by |
|---|---|---|
| diagnostic_version_id | 13 B | fixed `AZURE_INIT_V1` token |
| agent | 32 B | free-form producer id |
| name | 48 B | free-form subject |
| vm_id, event_id | 36 B each | GUID / UUID |
| timestamp | 24 B | fixed format |
| boot_epoch, duration | 10 B each | digits |
| result, encoding, kind | ≤ 7 B each | enum token |
| chunk_index | 4 B | at most 1023 records |

With those caps the worst-case key is 243 bytes, leaving 11 bytes inside the limit. cloud-init reads are never capped; the bridge takes names as they are.

### Kinds

`kind` marks where a record sits in an operation's timeline, and only that: `start` opens a timed operation, `finish` closes one, and `event` is a one-off that opens and closes nothing. Those three cover every position. A would-be fourth kind is really something the key already records: how the bytes are packed (`encoding`), what the record is about (`name`), or how it turned out (`result`). No kind carries a structured payload; the value is always a plain message or an artifact read per `encoding`.

For a concrete case, cloud-init's `type` field carries `compressed` and `system-info` tokens beside the same three. Neither is a timeline position: `compressed` is how the bytes are packed, an `encoding` here, and `system-info` is a subject, a `name`. How cloud-init's tokens map onto these three is in Compatibility.

#### start

A `start` opens a span, an operation that takes measurable time such as `provision:run`. Its `timestamp` marks when the operation began, and its value is a short opening message.

It shares one `event_id` with its `finish`; that shared id is what ties the pair, so a `start` whose `finish` never arrives stands out as an operation that began but never ended, exactly the signal an operator wants after a hang or crash.

```text
AZURE_INIT_V1|azure-init-0.1.1|1700000000|vm-abc|start|provision:run|9c1d2e3f-...|2026-08-31T12:34:56.789Z|none|||0   value: starting
```

#### finish

A `finish` closes the span it shares an `event_id` with. Its `timestamp` is later than the start's, and it reports the operation's outcome directly in the key: `result` is `success` or `fail`, and `duration` is the elapsed milliseconds. The writer holds the start instant, so it stamps `duration` at emit time rather than making a reader pair the two records to recover it, and a truncated pool that kept only the finish still carries both the verdict and the elapsed time. The value stays a human message such as `provisioning succeeded` or `provisioning failed: <reason>`. cloud-init carries the same fields in its value JSON, which the bridge maps across (see Compatibility).

```text
AZURE_INIT_V1|azure-init-0.1.1|1700000000|vm-abc|finish|provision:run|9c1d2e3f-...|2026-08-31T12:34:57.101Z|none|success|312|0   value: provisioning succeeded
```

#### event

An `event` is a point observation with no open or close: a single fact captured at one moment, such as an IMDS result or a `dmesg` snapshot. It has its own `event_id`, with no start or finish to pair. Most diagnostics are events.

Its value is the observed payload, read per `encoding`: a short text as `none`, or a large artifact the caller marks for compression as `gz+b64`, split across chunks that share the `event_id` and differ only by `chunk_index`. An event may also set `result` (`success`/`fail`) when the observation is itself a pass or failure, and `duration` when it measured how long something took with no start and finish to bracket it; it leaves either empty when it does not apply.

```text
# plain text, one record

AZURE_INIT_V1|azure-init-0.1.1|1700000000|vm-abc|event|dmesg|9a1b...|<ts>|gz+b64|||1   value: <chunk 1>
```

### Encodings

`encoding` names how the value bytes are formed, chosen by the caller when it emits a diagnostic rather than guessed from size, so the choice is deterministic. It lives in the key so a reader knows it without parsing the value, and the value stays a single opaque payload rather than a wrapper. base64 is required for any binary, because the store holds values as UTF-8 and trims trailing nulls, so raw bytes would not survive a round trip. Because the encoding is a key token, a new one can be added later without a format change; cloud-init instead declares its encoding inside the value (see Compatibility).

Whatever the encoding, a value over the 1022-byte limit is split across chunks that share the value's `event_id` and `kind` and are ordered by `chunk_index`; decoding joins them in order before anything else.

#### none

Plain UTF-8 text, the default and the common case. The value is the message as stored, so decoding is a no-op; a split value is just the text slices joined in index order. Span messages and short observations use `none`.

#### b64

Standard base64 of the raw payload bytes, for binary that will not shrink usefully. Decoding joins the chunks and base64-decodes them back to the original bytes. The key stays text and the binary survives the UTF-8 store.

#### gz+b64

base64 of gzip of the raw payload bytes, for a large compressible artifact such as `dmesg`. Writing gzips the payload, base64-encodes the result, then chunks it; decoding joins the chunks, base64-decodes, and gunzips. It is one gzip stream spread across the chunks, so any missing chunk makes the whole artifact `Undecodable` (see Reads and writes), the cost it trades for far fewer records.

### Reads and writes

A pool holds many diagnostics. Each is a start, finish, or event, and each is stored as one or more chunks (`chunk_index` 0 to N):

```text
Diagnostics pool
├─ start   provision:run
│  └─ chunk 0
├─ event   imds
│  └─ chunk 0
├─ event   dmesg  (gz+b64, 3 chunks)
│  ├─ chunk 0
│  ├─ chunk 1
│  └─ chunk 2
└─ finish  provision:run
   └─ chunk 0
```

`DiagnosticReader::entries()` reads the pool once and interprets every record, returning one `Entry` each: it combines and decodes a diagnostic into a `Diagnostic`, parses the `PROVISIONING_REPORT` into a `ProvisioningReport`, and leaves anything else as `Raw` (its key and value). A recognized record that will not parse — a broken diagnostic group, an unsupported azure-init diagnostics version, or a malformed report — also falls back to `Raw`, carrying the `DecodeError`, so nothing is dropped. A caller that wants the untouched records reads `KvpPoolStore` directly.

Writing is the inverse: `DiagnosticWriter` stamps `AZURE_INIT_V1`, frames a diagnostic into records, and appends them to the `KvpPoolStore`.

Reading the pool like a log is the `Diagnostic` entries in timestamp order. The host may reorder the pool, so a reader sorts on the timestamp each carries, and each becomes one line:

```text
2026-08-31T12:34:56.789Z  start   provision:run
2026-08-31T12:34:57.020Z  event   imds            ok
2026-08-31T12:34:57.101Z  finish  provision:run   success   312ms
```

Splitting the type by kind is what keeps each line honest: a `finish` always carries its `result` and `duration`, a `start` carries neither, and an `event` carries either when the caller measured it, so the renderer never second-guesses an optional field. An operation that began but never finished is a `Start` with no matching `Finish`, still printed in place, which is the signal an operator wants after a crash:

```text
2026-08-31T12:35:10.000Z  start   provision:run
(no finish)
```

A finished operation already carries its `duration` on its finish line, so there is nothing to roll up. Pairing a start to its finish is a plain group-by on `event_id` when a reader wants both ends at once, and a start with no matching finish is an operation that began but never ended.

```

The `diagnostic_version_id` is part of every azure-init group key, so chunks from different schemas can never combine. The rest of the group key includes `kind` because a span's start and finish share an `event_id`. There is no decode-time size limit either: the producer is trusted and the pool bounds the input, so an artifact either fits when it is written or is never written.

## Crate design

The crate exposes two interfaces over `KvpPoolStore`; neither holds files or locks, and both delegate all IO to the store. A provisioning client writes through `DiagnosticWriter`, while a diagnostic consumer reads through `DiagnosticReader`; a caller that wants untyped records uses the store directly. The writer produces azure-init records only. The reader understands supported azure-init versions and reads cloud-init through the bridge. The format and behavior are in Proposed design; the types, API, and CLI are here.

Their initialization is deliberately asymmetric. `DiagnosticReader` needs only a store because every source, identity, boot, and format decision comes from the records it reads; constructing one performs no IO. `DiagnosticWriter` needs the store plus the local `agent` and `vm_id`, validates that stable producer identity once, and obtains the boot epoch once for every record it will emit. It always writes the crate's current `AZURE_INIT_V1` format; callers cannot select a version or ask it to write cloud-init records. A process that needs both interfaces constructs them from clones of the same `KvpPoolStore`.

```rust
const AZURE_INIT_DIAGNOSTIC_VERSION_ID: &str = "AZURE_INIT_V1";

enum Kind { Start, Finish, Event }

/// Plain text is `None`; a value names an encoding only when it has one.
/// `Other` keeps an unknown token so it decodes to `Undecodable`, never a panic.

### CLI

`dump` prints every record in pool order as raw `KEY=VALUE`. `--parse` is an add-on: it interprets each record, decoding diagnostics and parsing the `PROVISIONING_REPORT` into a `ProvisioningReport`, and leaves anything it does not recognize as its raw key and value. Nothing is dropped.

```text
dump           -> every record, raw KEY=VALUE
dump --parse   -> known records parsed (Diagnostic, ProvisioningReport); the rest stay Raw
```

- `--parse` calls `DiagnosticReader::entries()`, one `Entry` per item. A recognized record that will not parse — a broken diagnostic, an unsupported azure-init diagnostics version, or a malformed report — stays `Raw` with its `DecodeError`, so its key, value, and the reason are all shown.
- `--name` filters the parsed diagnostics by name; other entries are unaffected.

Examples:

```text
# dump: every record raw, including the report and a dmesg chunk whose group was truncated
$ dump
AZURE_INIT_V1|azure-init-0.1.1|1700000000|vm-abc|finish|provision:run|9c1d...|2026-08-31T12:34:57.101Z|none|success|312|0=provisioning succeeded

## Adoption

azure-init adopts `AZURE_INIT_V1` by cutting over to it when it switches to the kvp crate; this is the first supported azure-init diagnostics format. The unversioned azure-init shape under Records today is pre-adoption rather than a compatibility contract: `DiagnosticReader` leaves one of those records as `Raw` instead of guessing which schema it follows. There are no prior records to migrate.

Updating cloud-init to emit this format is a non-goal for now and may be revisited; until then cloud-init is read-only through the compatibility bridge.

## Compatibility

cloud-init writes diagnostics into the same pool in its own format. `DiagnosticReader` dispatches its records to a read-only bridge that maps them onto the same model; `DiagnosticWriter` never writes cloud-init's format, and the `AZURE_INIT_V1` parser never parses a cloud-init value.

cloud-init keys put the type and name before the identifiers, and current keys include a `vm_id` that older keys omit:

```text
current  CLOUD_INIT|<incarnation>|<type>|<name>|<vm_id>|<event_id>[|<chunk_index>]
older    CLOUD_INIT|<incarnation>|<type>|<name>|<event_id>[|<chunk_index>]
```

The value is JSON telemetry carrying `name`, `type`, `ts`, and `msg`, with `result` and `duration` on a span finish, a per-chunk `msg_i` on each chunk of a split value, and, for a compressed artifact, a `{encoding, data}` envelope inside `msg`.

The bridge maps fields onto the model:

| Model field | cloud-init source |
|---|---|
| agent | the literal `CLOUD_INIT` |
| boot_epoch | `incarnation` |
| kind | `type` (`start`, `finish`, else `event`) |
| name | `name` |
| vm_id | present only on current keys |
| event_id | trailing key identifier |
| timestamp | value `ts`, read by the bridge when it maps the record |
| result | value field on a finish, mapped to the model's `result` |
| duration | value field on a finish (seconds; the bridge converts to milliseconds) |
| encoding | the value `{encoding, data}` envelope, not the key |

cloud-init has no `AZURE_INIT_V1` field and the bridge does not invent one. Its `CLOUD_INIT` prefix selects the bridge, which performs its source-specific parsing before constructing the same version-independent `DiagnosticKey` as the azure-init parser.

Reassembly is cloud-init specific: chunks are JSON objects, so the bridge validates each `msg_i` against the chunk index, concatenates the still-escaped `msg` slices, and unescapes the joined string once. If the result is an `{encoding, data}` envelope, the bridge decodes it with the same encodings as the core; otherwise the message is the payload. cloud-init declares its encoding in the value, which is why it is read there and not from the key.
